# Apptainer Examples

> During the October 26, 2022 maintenance window, Singularity was removed and replaced with [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/). The commands ```singularity``` (now a link pointing to Apptainer) and ```apptainer``` may be used to perform all the same operations you're used to and you can still run your existing images. However, remote builds via SyLabs are no longer supported. This examples repository is being actively updated to reflect these changes. Pardon our mess.
