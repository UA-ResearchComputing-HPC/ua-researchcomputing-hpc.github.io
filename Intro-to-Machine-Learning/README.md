# Intro to Machine Learning

[![](/Images/download.png)](intro-to-ML.tar.gz)

This short training class is available to users periodically throughout each academic year. Information on upcoming workshops can be found in our [training documentation](https://public.confluence.arizona.edu/display/UAHPC/Training). Before each workshop, an email will be sent to all HPC users through hpc-announce with information on dates, timing, location, and registration.

This workshop provides a brief introduction to key concepts of machine learning and is followed by two hands-on examples that emphasize running a Jupyter notebook on the HPC supercomputers. 

A PDF of the slides from past workshops can be found in our training documentation linked above.
