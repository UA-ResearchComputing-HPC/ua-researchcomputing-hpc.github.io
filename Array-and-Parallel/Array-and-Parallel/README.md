# Array Job with GNU Parallel
[![](/Images/Download-Button.png)](Array-and-Parallel.tar.gz)


This script combines the methods of the basic array job and the basic parallel job to execute a large number of jobs.

## What problem does this help fix? 
Sometimes you need to run a *lot* of jobs. More than can be reasonably accomplished using arrays since submitting thousands of jobs can be a problem for the system, and GNU Parallel can be challenging to make work in a multi-node environment. In this case, we can combine the forces of GNU Parallel and array jobs to distribute a chunk of tasks across multiple nodes where GNU Parallel will execute them

## Example

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=Sample_Array_With_GNU_Parallel
#SBATCH --ntasks=94
#SBATCH --nodes=1                    
#SBATCH --time=00:05:00   
#SBATCH --partition=standard
#SBATCH --account=YOUR_GROUP
#SBATCH --array=1-2

module load parallel
BLOCK_SIZE=200
seq $(($SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID*$BLOCK_SIZE-$BLOCK_SIZE+1)) $(($SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID*$BLOCK_SIZE)) | parallel echo "JOB ID: $SLURM_JOB_ID HOST NODE: $HOSTNAME EXAMPLE COMMAND: ./executable input_{}"
```

## Script Breakdown
Like with the basic parallel example, GNU Parallel is accessible as a module. The general goal here for illustration purposes is to set up a "block size". This is the number of tasks GNU Parallel will be executing in each subjob
```bash
BLOCK_SIZE=200
```
In this case, we're asking for 200 tasks per subjob and since we're submitting an array job, that totals 400 tasks. The array indices then used to differentiate tasks. ```seq n m``` generates a sequence of integers from ```n``` to ```m``` (inclusive).


```SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID``` is either 1 or 2, depending on the subjob, so combined with ```BLOCK_SIZE```:

**Subjob 1**: 
```bash
seq $(($SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID*$BLOCK_SIZE-$BLOCK_SIZE+1)) $(($SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID*$BLOCK_SIZE))
# Doing the math --> seq 1*200-200+1 1*200 --> seq 1 200
```

**Subjob 2**: 
```bash 
seq $(($SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID*$BLOCK_SIZE-$BLOCK_SIZE+1)) $(($SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID*$BLOCK_SIZE))
# Doing the math --> seq 2*200-200+1 2*200 --> seq 201 400
```
