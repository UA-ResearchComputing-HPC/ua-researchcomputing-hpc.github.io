# General Script Examples

## About
These examples are designed to demonstrate how to run jobs and request resources on HPC using the job scheduler SLURM. Each example comes with downloadable scripts that can be run with minor modifications.

## Scripts
### [Serial Job](Serial-Job-Example)
A basic example script that requests a single CPU on one node.

### [High Memory Node Job](High-Memory-Node)
A basic example demonstrating how to request a high memory node on either Ocelote or Puma.

### [Retrieving Scratch Files](Cleanup-Tmp-Files)
Example of using a compute node's local storage, or scratch space, during a job's execution and retrieving the output before the job's walltime limit is reached.
