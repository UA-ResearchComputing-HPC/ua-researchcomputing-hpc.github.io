# R Examples
This repository provides some examples for how to submit R analyses as batch jobs. R jobs may also be run using [interactive terminal sessions](https://public.confluence.arizona.edu/display/UAHPC/Running+Jobs+with+SLURM#RunningJobswithSLURM-Interactivecommand) or using [RStudio through Open OnDemand](https://public.confluence.arizona.edu/display/UAHPC/Open+On+Demand#OpenOnDemand-RStudio). For information on using R on HPC, see our [R documentation](https://public.confluence.arizona.edu/display/UAHPC/Using+and+Customizing+R+Packages). 

## [Basic R Example](Basic-R-Example)
A basic "Hello World!" example.

## [Plotting in a Batch Script](Plotting-In-R)
Creating and saving figures as a part of your workflow is possible in a batch script. You can save your figure to a specified directory (the default is your working directory), give it a custom name, control your image quality and dimensions, and choose your output format (e.g., pdf, png, jpg, etc.). An example is included below.
