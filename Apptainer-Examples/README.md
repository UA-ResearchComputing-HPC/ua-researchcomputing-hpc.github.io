# Apptainer Examples

> During the October 26, 2022 maintenance window, Singularity was removed and replaced with [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/). The commands ```singularity``` (now a link pointing to Apptainer) and ```apptainer``` may be used to perform all the same operations you're used to and you can still run your existing images. However, remote builds via SyLabs are no longer supported. 

> ⚠️This examples repository is being actively updated to reflect the apptainer changes. Pardon our mess.⚠️
