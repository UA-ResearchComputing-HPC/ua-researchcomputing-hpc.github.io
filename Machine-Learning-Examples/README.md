# Machine Learning Examples #

> :bulb: If you have never run a batch job before, see our [Quick Start Guide](https://public.confluence.arizona.edu/display/UAHPC/Puma+Quick+Start) for a walkthrough. We also have a [video recording of our Intro to HPC workshop](https://public.confluence.arizona.edu/display/UAHPC/Training#Training-IntroductiontoHPC) that goes over system use and batch scripts. Intro to HPC also comes with a [companion page](https://ua-researchcomputing-hpc.github.io/Intro-to-HPC/).

This page has a collection of various machine learning examples that users may find helpful. For a basic introduction to machine learning on HPC, see our [machine learning workshop](/Intro-to-Machine-Learning).
