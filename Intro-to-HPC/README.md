# Intro to HPC

[![](/Images/download-button.png)](intro-to-HPC.tar.gz)

This short training class is available to users periodically throughout each academic year. Information on upcoming workshops can be found in our [training documentation](https://public.confluence.arizona.edu/display/UAHPC/Training). Before each workshop, an email will be sent to all HPC users through hpc-announce with information on dates, timing, location, and registration.

This training course will help you get started on using HPC resources.  If you have recently started, you might learn there is a better way, or there are capabilities you are not taking advantage of.

A PDF of the slides from past workshops can be found in our training documentation linked above.
