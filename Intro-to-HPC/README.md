# Overview

This short training class is available to users periodically throughout each academic year. Information on upcoming workshops can be found in our [training documentation](https://public.confluence.arizona.edu/display/UAHPC/Training). Before each workshop, an email will be sent to all HPC users through hpc-announce with information on dates, times, location, and how to register.

This training course will help you get started on using HPC resources.  If you have recently started, you might learn there is a better way, or there are capabilities you are not taking advantage of. You may also want to go through our [quick start](https://public.confluence.arizona.edu/display/UAHPC/Puma+Quick+Start) for additional information.

A PDF of the slides from past workshops can be found in our training documentation linked above and can be downloaded by clicking the Download PDF button at the top of this page. A summary of the training material for the interactive component of this workshop can be found below.

# System Basics

## Logging In
<img src="cluster-diagram.png" alt="cluster-diagram" style="float: left; margin: 3px 12px 3px 0px; box-shadow: 10px 10px 10px grey;" align="left" width="400"/> 

To begin, open a terminal session and connect to HPC. This can be done two ways, either using your own terminal/SSH client, or through our Open OnDemand web interface. You will use your university credentials (NetID and password) to access the system and will also be prompted for a method to duo authenticate after.

Detailed information can be found in our [online documentation](https://public.confluence.arizona.edu/display/UAHPC/System+Access#SystemAccess-CommandLine/TerminalAccess).

### Local terminal
#### Mac/Linux
On a Mac or Linux, open a Terminal (on Mac, this can be found under Applications -> Utilities), and connect to the system using the following as a guide:
```
ðŸ’» intro-to-hpc $ ssh your_netid@hpc.arizona.edu
Password: # <- your password goes here
Duo two-factor login for your_netid

Enter a passcode or select one of the following options:

 1. Duo Push to XXX-XXX-XXXX
 2. SMS passcodes to XXX-XXX-XXXX (next code starts with: X)

Passcode or option (1-2): 1
Success. Logging you in...
This is a bastion host used to access the rest of the RT/HPC environment.

Type "shell" to access the job submission hosts for all environments
-----------------------------------------

[your_netid@gatekeeper 16:26:46 ~]$ shell
***
The default cluster for job submission is Puma
***
Shortcut commands change the target cluster
-----------------------------------------
Puma:
$ puma
(puma) $
Ocelote:
$ ocelote
(ocelote) $
ElGato:
$ elgato
(elgato) $
-----------------------------------------

(puma) [your_netid@wentletrap ~]$ ocelote
(ocelote) [your_netid@wentletrap ~]$ 

```
#### Windows

On Windows, you will need an SSH client such as PuTTY or MobaXterm. In PuTTY, use ```hpc.arizona.edu``` as your hostname, click Open, then enter your NetID at the ```login as``` promt. Once you have duo-authenticated, type ```shell```, then ```ocelote``` to connect to Ocelote.

### Open OnDemand
Log into [https://ood.hpc.arizona.edu/](https://ood.hpc.arizona.edu/), then select the **Clusters** dropdown tab and click **Shell Access**
<img src="ood_shell_access.png" alt="ood_shell_access" width="786"/>

Once you're connected, type ```ocelote``` to connect to Ocelote.

## Basic Commands
Once you're logged in, you can interact with the system using Bash commands. Some basics are provided below if you are unfamiliar with its syntax. 

### Bash

|Command|What it does|
|--------|------------------|
|```ls``` | Lists the contents of a directory |
|```pwd```| Prints the location of your working directory |
|```whoami```|Prints your username | 
|```hostname```|Prints the name of the machine you're connected to|
|```which <command>```|Prints the location of the executable ```<command>```|
|```mkdir <directory_name>```| Create a directory with name ```<directory_name>```|
|```cd```|Change directories|
|```cp <source> <destination>```|Copies a file/directory from ```source``` to ```destination```|
|```cat <filename>```|Prints the contents of a text file ```<filename>``` to the terminal|


### HPC-Specific

|Command|What it does|
|--------|------------------|
|```uquota```|Checks your storage usage|
|```va```|Checks your group's monthly time allocation|
|```nodes-busy```|Displays a visual of a cluster's compute nodes and their usage|
|```system-busy```|Displays a text-based summary of a cluster's compute nodes and their usage|
|```cluster-busy```|Displays a visual of each cluster's average usage. Only available on the login nodes|
|```job-history <jobid>    ```|Prints a detailed summary of a running/completed job|
|```seff <jobid>```|Prints a summary of a completed job's memory and CPU efficiency|


# Submitting a Sample Job
## Accessing Workshop Files

To access the files you need for this workshop, use the following commands:

```
mkdir intro-to-hpc
cd intro-to-hpc
cp /xdisk/chrisreidy/workshops/sample_slurm.script .
```
Note, the ```.``` at the end. This is shorthand for your current working directory.

If you get a permission denied message using cp, you likely havenâ€™t been added to the group chrisreidy. If this is the case, stay in your intro-to-hpc directory and use:
```
wget https://ua-researchcomputing-hpc.github.io/Intro-to-HPC/intro-to-hpc.tar.gz
tar xzvf intro-to-hpc.tar.gz --strip-components=1
rm intro-to-hpc.tar.gz
```

## Submission Script Overview
The bash command ```cat``` will print a file's contents to your screen. View the contents of the sample script you just copied using:
```
cat sample_slurm.script
```
This should display the following:
```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=test
#SBATCH -e test.e%A
#SBATCH -o test.o%A
#SBATCH --mail-type=ALL
#SBATCH --mail-user=netid@email.arizona.edu
#SBATCH --partition=windfall
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --time=00:10:00

echo 'This script is running on:'
hostname
sleep 120
```



## Submitting Your Batch Job
The command ```sbatch``` will submit your script to the job scheduler to run on one of Ocelote's compute nodes:
```
sbatch sample_slurm.script
```
If everything worked correctly, a job ID will be printed to the screen that you can use to track it's progress using:
```
squeue --job <your_job_id>
```

For example:
```
(ocelote) [netid@wentletrap intro-to-hpc]$ sbatch sample_slurm.script 
Submitted batch job 463482
(ocelote) [netid@wentletrap intro-to-hpc]$ squeue --job 463482
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME  USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
            463482  windfall     test netid PD       0:00      1 (Priority)
```

## Job Output
Once your job starts running, an output file will be created in the directory where you submitted your script. In this case, you will have two output files that will look like ```test.o<jobid>``` and ```test.e<jobid>```. The first will be any standard output that would have been printed to the terminal had you run your work interactively and the second will contain any errors. First, check if you have output files using ```ls```. If they exist, check their contents using ```cat```. For example:

```
(ocelote) [netid@wentletrap intro-to-hpc]$ ls
test.e463482  test.o463482  sample_slurm.script
(ocelote) [netid@wentletrap intro-to-hpc]$ cat test.o463482 
This script is running on:
i11n1.ocelote.hpc.arizona.edu
```
