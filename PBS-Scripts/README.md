# PBS Scripts (Ocelote and ElGato)

## About
PBS is the scheduling software used on HPC clusters Ocelote and ElGato. The scripts in this repository are written for execution on Ocelote unless otherwise noted. Similar techniques can be used to execute similar workflows on ElGato as well. Because Ocelote and ElGato are distinct clusters, modules found on one may either not exist on the other or may have a different naming scheme. To see what modules are available in your workspace, you may use the command ```module avail```.
